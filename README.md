Hi, I’m Orit Davidovich. I work at IBM as an applied math research scientist.<br>
I spend my days thinking about data-driven optimzation while experimenting in quite hands-on ways.<br>
Experimentation means that I often spend considerable time on how to best deploy and distribute stuff on a cluster.<br>
You can reach me at orit.davidovich at ibm.com
